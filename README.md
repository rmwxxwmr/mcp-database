# MCP Database Service

A multi-database MCP server for Model Context Protocol (MCP), written in TypeScript.

It supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, openGauss, and Redis, with lazy short-lived connections, read-oriented database tools, SQL plan analysis, config reload, and guarded write execution.

This project is intended for AI agents and MCP clients that need safe database discovery, querying, performance analysis, and controlled write operations.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js --config ./config/databases.example.json
```

Or install globally:

```powershell
pwsh -File .\scripts\install-global.ps1
```

## Support Matrix

| Database | Query Tools | Metadata Tools | `explain_query` | `analyze_query` | Write Support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MySQL | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| PostgreSQL | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| openGauss | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Oracle | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |
| Redis | Yes | Limited to Redis tools | No | No | No |

## Supported Databases
- MySQL
- Oracle
- PostgreSQL
- openGauss (via PostgreSQL protocol compatibility)
- Redis

## Features
- Multiple named database targets in a single config file
- Manual config reload without restarting the MCP server
- Automatic config reload when the JSON file changes on disk
- Strict read-only enforcement for query tools
- Optional write execution with explicit MCP confirmation for writable targets
- Lazy connections with guaranteed cleanup after each request
- Metadata discovery tools for SQL databases
- Dedicated read tools for Redis

## Configuration
Provide the config path by one of these methods:

1. `node dist/index.js --config ./config/databases.json`
2. Set `MCP_DATABASE_CONFIG=/absolute/path/to/databases.json`

The configuration file must be a JSON array. Example:

```json
[
  {
    "key": "main-mysql",
    "type": "mysql",
    "readonly": true,
    "connection": {
      "host": "127.0.0.1",
      "port": 3306,
      "databaseName": "app_db",
      "user": "root",
      "password": "secret",
      "connectTimeoutMs": 5000
    }
  }
]
```

Oracle supports both Thin and Thick mode. Thick mode uses the same `oracledb` package, but requires Oracle Instant Client on the host machine. Example:

```json
{
  "key": "oracle-thick-example",
  "type": "oracle",
  "readonly": true,
  "connection": {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 1521,
    "serviceName": "XEPDB1",
    "user": "system",
    "password": "secret",
    "clientMode": "thick",
    "clientLibDir": "C:\\oracle\\instantclient_19_25"
  }
}
```

## Available MCP Tools
- `show_loaded_config`: show the current in-memory config path, load time, and all configured database targets
- `reload_config`: reload the JSON config file currently in use and atomically replace the in-memory configuration on success
- `list_databases`: list all configured target keys and logical database names without opening database connections
- `ping_database`: test connectivity for one configured target
- `list_schemas`: list schemas for one SQL target
- `list_tables`: list tables/views under one SQL schema or the default schema
- `describe_table`: inspect columns before writing joins, reports, or optimization SQL
- `list_indexes`: inspect table indexes for performance analysis
- `get_table_statistics`: inspect approximate row counts, storage metrics, and database-specific table statistics
- `execute_query`: run one read-only SQL query; pass the original query SQL, not write SQL
- `explain_query`: get the static execution plan for one read-only SQL query; pass the original query SQL, not `EXPLAIN ...`
- `analyze_query`: get runtime analysis for one read-only SQL query; pass the original query SQL, not `EXPLAIN ANALYZE ...`
- `execute_statement`: run one non-query SQL statement on a writable target after explicit manual confirmation
- `redis_get`: read one Redis string key
- `redis_hgetall`: read one Redis hash key
- `redis_scan`: cursor-scan Redis keys safely with an optional pattern

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js --config ./config/databases.example.json
```

## Global Installation

This project exposes a CLI command named `mcp-database-service` through the package `bin` field.

Recommended options:

1. Use the helper script:

```powershell
pwsh -File .\scripts\install-global.ps1
```

The helper script installs dependencies, builds the project, creates a tarball with `npm pack`, installs that tarball globally with `npm install -g <tarball>`, and then deletes the temporary tarball. It does not use `npm link`.

2. Or install the packed tarball manually:

```powershell
npm pack
npm install -g .\mcp-database-service-0.1.0.tgz
```

The package only publishes runtime files through the `files` field, so packaged installation includes `dist` and the runtime README/config example, not the whole source tree.

After installation, the command can be used like this:

```powershell
mcp-database-service --config .\config\databases.example.json
```

If you publish this package to npm later, the install form becomes:

```powershell
npm install -g mcp-database-service
```

Example MCP server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "database": {
      "command": "mcp-database-service",
      "args": [
        "--config",
        "C:\\path\\to\\databases.json"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Config Reload

- The server loads the JSON config file at startup and keeps a validated in-memory snapshot.
- The server also watches the same JSON file and automatically reloads it after on-disk changes are detected.
- Automatic reload is debounced to avoid reloading half-written files too aggressively.
- You can still use `reload_config` to force a manual reload without restarting the process.
- Reload is atomic: if the new file is invalid, the old in-memory configuration remains active.
- `show_loaded_config` can be used to inspect the current config path, load time, and configured database targets.
- `show_loaded_config` also includes a sanitized connection summary for each target, such as host, port, databaseName or serviceName, user name, and Oracle client mode, but it never exposes passwords.

## Oracle Notes
- Thin mode is the default when `clientMode` is omitted.
- Thick mode requires `clientMode: "thick"` and a valid `clientLibDir`.
- All Oracle targets in one process must use the same client mode. Thick mode targets must also share the same `clientLibDir`.
- `analyze_query` is currently not supported for Oracle and will return `NOT_SUPPORTED`.

## Write Statements
- `execute_query` remains read-only and blocks non-query SQL.
- `execute_statement` is intended for writable SQL targets only.
- `execute_statement` requires `readonly: false` on the target database config.
- Before executing a non-query SQL statement, the server asks the MCP client for explicit user confirmation through MCP elicitation when the client supports it.
- If the MCP client does not support elicitation, `execute_statement` automatically falls back to a two-step confirmation flow: the first call returns confirmation details and a `confirmationId`, and the second call must resend the same SQL with `confirmationId` and `confirmExecution: true` after the user confirms.
- `execute_statement` confirmation includes SQL type, target object, SQL preview, parameter preview, and risk hints for dangerous statements.
